attribute:
    as_enum for when you want an integer to be treated like an enum
        type attribute value type
    struct/union values
    stb_ds array attribute
    members of complex type can specify an attribute as a value: I(default default)

    nodisplay
    ability to apply attributes to types
    ability to remove an attribute
    expression/condition attribute type
    length: allow expression? ex. I(length map_width * map_height)
    stb_ds hash map attribute?

parse:
    !! sizeof structs/enums in expressions
    give c int types a parent based on size and signedness
    add way to change c type sizes for different platforms
    track type declaration file location?
    functions
    function pointers
    handle bit field accessing
    handle strings next to each other
    const flag?
    parse float expressions
    rudimentary C++ support

pre:
    fix highlighting of expanded macros
    parse #line directives
    create #line directives?
    better config system for system headers and defines

gen:
    option to create typedefs for structs and enums
    typeof with _Generic?

city:
    ability to use id instead of member name

lib:
    accurate type display
    IntroVariant?
    don't use printf?
    single header?

test:
    test for failures that should happen
    should tests and examples be separate things?

doc:

misc:
    use enum error codes instead of magic numbers
    parse program options and pass only relevant ones to sub-processes
    strange mixture of text parsing and token list parsing is becoming a problem
